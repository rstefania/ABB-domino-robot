# ABB Domino Robot

## Overview
This project was developed in ABB RobotStudio using a Pack & Go archive (.rspag).
It simulates an ABB robotic arm that pushes domino pieces in sequence. The project demonstrates motion programming and automation principles.

## Files included
- ABB robot domino project.rspag – Pack & Go project archive (can be opened with ABB RobotStudio)
- README.md – Project description

## Requirements
- ABB RobotStudio
- RobotWare 5.61.08.00

## How to open
1. Open ABB RobotStudio
2. Use the "Pack & Go" option and select "Unpack"
3. Load the file ABB robot domino project.rspag
4. Start the simulation

## Description
The robot performs a simple task of pushing dominoes one after another. The sequence shows basic robotic movements, toolpath configuration and event triggering inside RobotStudio.
